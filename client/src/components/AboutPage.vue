      I am a full stack software engineer. In my previous math classes at college I kept hearing students say those concepts are not used in
      real life jobs. And I totally disagree with them, solving complex logarithmic problems with code makes me very excited. In the next
      phase of my career, I not only want to use my problem solving skills to make the application satisfy what the customer needs, but I
      also want to work on the technically challenging facets of the application too. In my previous projects, I have led my teams to
      success with clear instructions and great communications. I am very passionate about software development and a quick learner since I
      was able to learn so many hard concepts in a very short amount of time.
